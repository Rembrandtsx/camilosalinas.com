            and ducking each to other with their shaven reverences, whether the author, who stands by in perplexity at

            Imprimatur, one from Lambeth House, another from the west end of Paul's; so apishly Romanizing, that the
            word of command still was set down in Latin; as if the learned grammatical pen that wrote it would cast no
            ink without Latin; or perhaps, as they thought, because no vulgar tongue was worthy to express the pure
            conceit of an Imprimatur, but rather, as I hope, for that our English, the language of men ever famous and
            foremost in the achievements of liberty, will not easily find servile letters enow to spell such a dictatory
            presumption English.</p>

          <p>And thus ye have the inventors and the original of book-licensing ripped up and drawn as lineally as any
            pedigree. We have it not, that can be heard of, from any ancient state, or polity or church; nor by any
            statute left us by our ancestors elder or later; nor from the modern custom of any reformed city or church
            abroad, but from the most anti-christian council and the most tyrannous inquisition that ever inquired.</p>
          <p> Till then books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any other birth; the issue of the brain was
            no more stifled than the issue of the womb: no envious Juno sat cross-legged over the nativity of any man's
            intellectual offspring; but if it proved a monster, who denies, but that it was justly burnt, or sunk into
            the sea? </p>
          <p>But that a book, in worse condition than a peccant soul, should be to stand before a jury ere it be born to
            the world, and undergo yet in darkness the judgment of Radamanth and his colleagues, ere it can pass the
            ferry backward into light, was never heard before, till that mysterious iniquity, provoked and troubled at
            the first entrance of Reformation, sought out new limbos and new hells wherein they might include our books
            also within the number of their damned. And this was the rare morsel so officiously snatched up, and so
            ill-favouredly imitated by our inquisiturient bishops, and the attendant minorites their chaplains. That ye
            like not now these most certain authors of this licensing order, and that all sinister intention was far
            distant from your thoughts, when ye were importuned the passing it, all men who know the integrity of your
            actions, and how ye honour truth, will clear ye readily.</p>

          <p>They are not skilful considerers of human things, who imagine to remove sin by removing the matter of sin;
            for, besides that it is a huge heap increasing under the very act of diminishing, though some part of it may
            for a time be withdrawn from some persons, it cannot from all, in such a universal thing as books are; and
            when this is done, yet the sin remains entire. Though ye take from a covetous man all his treasure, he has
            yet one jewel left, ye cannot bereave him of his covetousness.</p>
          <p> Banish all objects of lust, shut up all youth into the severest discipline that can be exercised in any
            hermitage, ye cannot make them chaste, that came not hither so; such great care and wisdom is required to
            the right managing of this point. Suppose we could expel sin by this means; look how much we thus expel of
            sin, so much we expel of virtue: for the matter of them both is the same; remove that, and ye remove them
            both alike.</p>

            end of Paul's; so apishly Romanizing, that the word of command still was set down in Latin; as if the
            learned grammatical pen that wrote it would cast no ink without Latin; or perhaps, as they thought, because
            no vulgar tongue was worthy to express the pure conceit of an Imprimatur, but rather, as I hope, for that
            our English, the language of men ever famous and foremost in the achievements of liberty, will not easily
            find servile letters enow to spell such a dictatory presumption English.</p>

          <p>Nay, which is more lamentable, if the work of any deceased author, though never so famous in his lifetime
            and even to this day, come to their hands for licence to be printed, or reprinted, if there be found in his
            book one sentence of a venturous edge, uttered in the height of zeal (and who knows whether it might not be
            the dictate of a divine spirit?). </p>
          <p>Yet not suiting with every low decrepit humour of their own, though it were Knox himself, the reformer of a
            kingdom, that spake it, they will not pardon him their dash: the sense of that great man shall to all
            posterity be lost, for the fearfulness or the presumptuous rashness of a perfunctory licenser. And to what
            an author this violence hath been lately done, and in what book of greatest consequence to be faithfully
            published, I could now instance, but shall forbear till a more convenient season.</p>

          <p>And it is a particular disesteem of every knowing person alive, and most injurious to the written labours
            and monuments of the dead, so to me it seems an undervaluing and vilifying of the whole nation. I cannot set
            so light by all the invention, the art, the wit, the grave and solid judgment which is in England, as that
            it can be comprehended in any twenty capacities how good soever, much less that it should not pass except
            their superintendence be over it, except it be sifted and strained with their strainers, that it should be
            uncurrent without their manual stamp. </p>
          <p>Truth and understanding are not such wares as to be monopolized and traded in by tickets and statutes and
            standards. We must not think to make a staple commodity of all the knowledge in the land, to mark and
            licence it like our broadcloth and our woolpacks. What is it but a servitude like that imposed by the
            Philistines, not to be allowed the sharpening of our own axes and coulters, but we must repair from all
            quarters to twenty licensing forges? </p>
          <p>Had anyone written and divulged erroneous things and scandalous to honest life, misusing and forfeiting the
            esteem had of his reason among men, if after conviction this only censure were adjudged him that he should
            never henceforth write but what were first examined by an appointed officer, whose hand should be annexed to
            pass his credit for him that now he might be safely read; it could not be apprehended less than a
            disgraceful punishment. Whence to include the whole nation, and those that never yet thus offended, under
            such a diffident and suspectful prohibition, may plainly be understood what a disparagement it is. So much
            the more, whenas debtors and delinquents may walk abroad without a keeper, but unoffensive books must not
            stir forth without a visible jailer in their title.</p>

          <p>And in conclusion it reflects to the disrepute of our ministers also, of whose labours we should hope
            better, and of the proficiency which their flock reaps by them, than that after all this light of the Gospel
            which is, and is to be, and all this continual preaching, they should still be frequented with such an
            unprincipled, unedified and laic rabble, as that the whiff of every new pamphlet should stagger them out of
            their catechism and Christian walking. </p>
          <p>This may have much reason to discourage the ministers when such a low conceit is had of all their
            exhortations, and the benefiting of their hearers, as that they are not thought fit to be turned loose to
            three sheets of paper without a licenser; that all the sermons, all the lectures preached, printed, vented
            in such numbers, and such volumes, as have now well nigh made all other books unsaleable, should not be
            armour enough against one single Enchiridion, without the castle of St. Angelo of an Imprimatur.</p>

            houses where drunkenness is sold and harboured? Our garments also should be referred to the licensing of
            some more sober workmasters to see them cut into a less wanton garb. </p>
